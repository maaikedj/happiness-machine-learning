## Data
The World Happiness Report data from 2015-2019 can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness) (five separate csv files, one for each year).  
I retrieved a csv file with 1400+ World Development Indicators for all countries from the [World Bank's website](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/) Under 'Bulk Downloads' you can download the data folder 'WDI_csv', in which the file 'WDIData.csv' is located.
